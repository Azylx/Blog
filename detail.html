<p style="font-size: 19; font-weight: 600;">1. Google Adsense</p>
When you visit a website, you can probably see Google ads. These ads are literally everywhere, and for a very good purpose too. These are very easy to set up on any kind of website and can be lucrative once your website starts bringing in a steady amount of traffic. <br><br>
One of the best things about Google AdSense is that it is very easy to get set up. You can literally sign up for a free Google AdSense Account if you have a blogger website. After signing up, Google will provide you with a unique code that you only need to paste onto your website. Google will take it from there, by tracking your traffic, page views, and earnings which will make your work a lot easier. There is no need of maintenance or upkeep to get this thing going, which makes it a lot simpler if you already have a website.<br><br>

You must be thinking how much you can make from this. To your surprise my best month with Google AdSense was almost $1,500 over the last two years. That amazing month really shocked me and blew my mind since it was actually near the beginning of my blogging journey. When you go from making zero to that much money, that will definitely rock your world. For me, it also got me more hyped and excited because I knew there were other ways to monetize. This will give you the motivation to keep going forward and strive for the best.
<br><br>


<p style="font-size: 19; font-weight: 600;">2. Affiliate Marketing</p>
If you have a website or are still coming up with ideas for a blog, you can also take a look at affiliate marketing. With this marketing strategy, you partner with various businessess and brands within the content of your website. When you sign up for a particular affiliate program, you link a mentioned product or service using a unique affiliate code that you received. Afterwards, all there is to making money any time someone buys a product or service through the link that you provide.
<br><br>
In general, you will have to partner with affiliates that are realted completely to your blog concept. Since I'm a investment advisor, I have focused a lot of my affiliate energy on investment schemes. You can come up with something that you have your expertise on. That will make you money while eating an ice cream.
<br><br>
In addition to signing up for individual affiliate programs, you can also sign up for an affiliate ad network which will boost up your understanding of this business. It will also offer a ton of different affiliates in one place. This way, you can monitor and observe about the things that actually work and things that don't.

With proper research and knowledge about this amazing strategy, you can actually make money even when you're sleeping or enjoying you vacation. If you know your audience and build up enough traffic to create sales, you can make money with nearly any affiliate company or product.
<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 19; font-weight: 600;">3. Consulting</p>

A great way to earn money online is via consulting. There is a very increasing demand of experts as people seek for answers online rather than any other means. If you're an expert in any field, you could potentially find people willing to pay you to counsel them on their personal issues or business goals. You may also not feel confident enough and end up thinking you can't consult for big companies, but you could be surprised at the types of expertise people will pay for.
<br><br>
After you start building your self esteem and keep going forward, you will eventually get tons of opportunites where you will realize that you have the best expertise for such matters. One after another you will get requests and chances that will make you earn surprisingly more than $100 per hour. Can you believe it? It's a very good opportunity if you think about it and if you have the potential.
<br><br>
If you really want to start consulting and feel like you are an expert in any field, then you can set up a free account through Clarity.fm. Websites like these lets anyone who wants to offer consulting set up a free profile so that you can grow. After setting up your profile, people will start finding you and book a session that you'll get paid for.
<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 19; font-weight: 600;">4. Online Courses</p>
If you have any skill you can teach others, it is more than possible for you to set up an online course you can makret online. You can find many online courses that teach various curious and surprising things or even content writing as a freelancer. I even offer my own course for starting your own business with minimal budget. 
<br><br>
It's never to late to start any course of action that might change your life completely. Just think about what you can do to make yourself standout amongst the crowd. Once you build up that confidence, there is no stopping you from making you some serious money online. 
<br><br>
Most people set up their online courses through online platforms as there are many in the present context. One of the very best examples can be Teachable.com. With Teachable, you can upload your own course materials and use the platform to manage customers as well as accept payments. Doesn't it sound smooth and simpler to start your own course for making money. 
<br><br>


<p style="font-size: 19; font-weight: 600;">5. Freelance Writing</p>
  If you have good writing skills and creative talent, it's more than possible to get paid to create online content on various topics. I don't do this as much as I used to, but I am very aware of how viable this source of income really is.
<br><br>
The key to making it as a freelance writer is figuring out a niche, networking with people who might hire you, and delivering the best quality content all the time as much as you can grind it from inside of you. There are a ton of writing job boards to help you get started, as only your impatience inside you can bring the best outcome from you. So, always think about what you can do best and create best.
